## Important techniques

* **Asymptotic methods** -- ie, approximation methods

## Important Theorems

**Gauss' Theorem** states that the divergence of a vector field, integrated over some volume \( V \), is equivalent to the integral of that vector field over the surface \( S \) bounding \( V \). In other words, 

\[ \int_{\mathbf V} \vec \nabla \cdot \vec A d^3 x = \int_{\mathbf S} \vec{ds} \cdot \vec A \]
