## Important techniques

* **Asymptotic methods** -- ie, approximation methods

## Important Theorems

**Gauss' Theorem** states that the divergence of a vector field, integrated over some volume \( V \), is equivalent to the integral of that vector field over the surface \( S \) bounding \( V \). In other words, 

\[ \int_{\mathbf V} \left( \vec \nabla \cdot \vec A \right) d^3 x  = \int_{\mathbf S}  \vec A \cdot \vec{ds}\]
