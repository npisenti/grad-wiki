## Definitions

**Generalized Coordinates** characterize the state of a system (they don't necessarily have to be spatial coordinates!). They are generally denoted \( q_i(t) \) for some \( i = 1, 2, \ldots \).

**Action** is the integral between two times \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) of a function known as the **Lagrangian**. Thus, the action \( S(t_1, t_2) \) is given by 

\[ S(t_1, t_2) = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot q, t) dt \]

**Hamilton's principle of least action** (sometimes called *Hamilton's principle* or the *principle of least action*, basically states that the behavior of a system is that which minimizes the action \( S(t_1, t_2) \). For example, we might ask a (general) question, "what path does some particle take between points \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \)? The principle of least action tells us that the particle follows the path which minimizes \( S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot q t) dt \) for the appropriate Lagrangian \( L(q, \dot q, t) \).
