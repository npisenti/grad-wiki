## Definitions

* **Generalized Coordinates** characterize the state of a system (they don't necessarily have to be spatial coordinates!). They are generally denoted \( q_i(t) \) for some \( i = 1, 2, \ldots \).
* **Action** is the integral between two times \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) of a function known as the **Lagrangian**. Thus, the action \( S(t_1, t_2) \) is given by 
\[ S(t_1, t_2) = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot q, t) dt \]
